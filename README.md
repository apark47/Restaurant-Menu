Final Project for Introductory Python Class in March 2023. 

This project displays a restaurant menu with functions that allow users to add, update, 
and delete items based on several variables, including name, calories, price, spice levels, 
and vegetarian status. It provides a restaurant expense rating and allows the user to load 
or save the menu to a CSV file.
